- head dont have \n?
- find tests need to have additional command? find . -name *.txt

cd, ls,
echo, grep, uniq
cut


questions
- can test the functions that go into stdin? (grep) but need an exit condition
- why uniq got len(args) == 0 and another else loop?
- why cut got first "if" loop? cut -b ./cutTest/cut1.txt will throw an error?
